## Running Training Optimization Application
### Objective
This project presents the development of an innovative application aimed at optimizing running training through advanced data analysis and artificial intelligence techniques. The primary goal of this thesis is to create a personalized training tool that helps runners avoid overtraining while maximizing key physical fitness components.

### Overview
The application is designed to adjust running paces to individual user parameters like maximum heart rate, running distance, and stride length, leveraging polynomial regression. This approach addresses gaps in existing market solutions by offering more tailored training guidance.

### Research and Development
Extensive research was conducted to analyze and compare existing tools and services, highlighting the need for a more personalized training approach. The application was built upon this research, using exploratory data analysis and feature selection methods to underpin the polynomial regression model's implementation.

#### Testing
Personalized Training Plans: Customized to individual user metrics for enhanced training effectiveness.
Polynomial Regression Model: Adjusts running pace based on key parameters including maximum heart rate, distance, and stride length.
Data-Driven Approach: Employs data analysis for accurate prediction of optimal running paces.
User Testing Validation: Application's precision and effectiveness confirmed through tests on user data.
